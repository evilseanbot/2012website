    <h3>DESIGN NOTES</h3>    
    <br>When someone clicks one of the existing account services OR Create an account,
    an email/password option appears, and the Next button becomes enabled.
    
    <br>Upon clicking Next, there are several error messages that this screen could give and prevent the person from going to the next page:
    <br>1: Email already exists in our system. You must use a unique email.
    <br>2: Email is not formatted correctly: stuff@stuff.stuff
    <br>3: Email or password contains not allowed characters: Maybe it doesn't allow weird latin characters.

    <br>If someone clicks Next while it is disabled, it visibily reacts, and a messgae will appear
         to announce that you can't click next until you choose one of the above options.
    
    <br>We have to take into account that people could be inputting wrong emails, 
    either maliciously or by mistake. We will consider the either possibility and
    incorperate appropiate soloutions.
